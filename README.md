To install the app on your device, follow these steps:

1. In the security settings section on your Android device, enable app installation from unknown sources. 
2. Copy the "release/" directory to any directory on your device. You find it in "app/app/".
3. On your device, open the "release/" directory and tap on the "app-release.apk" file and allow Android to install the app.
4. To enable full functionality, open the app settings section of your Android device. Open the settings of the "Handschrifterkennung" app. Open the permissions tab and enable memory access. If you omit this step, the app won't be able to save memo files on your device.
