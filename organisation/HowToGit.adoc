= Tiny *GitHub* HowTo


== Download
=== Cloning existing *GibHub* project to your computer
- create a directory on your computer, where you want to store your local copy
 of the project
- open a terminal (if not done yet)
- `cd` to your newly created project root directory
- type `git clone [url]` and insert the git repository url instead of 
 `[url]`
- If everything worked fine, *you now have your own local copy of the project!*

=== Downloading the most recent project state
- open a terminal and `cd` to the project root directory
- type `git pull`
- If everything worked fine, *you now have an up-to-date copy of the project!*
- If some conflicts occured while trying to download, see the __Solving merge 
 conflicts__ section
*Tip*:: Use `git pull` each time *before* you start working to avoid evil
 merge conflicts!
 
=== Solving merge conflicts
- If after typing `git pull` the command line shouts `CONFLICT` at you, don't 
 panic and go through the following steps
- first of all: whenever you like, you can abort solving the merge conflict and
 go back to the state before you typed `git pull`, just by typing `git rebase 
 --abort`
- to check, which files caused the conflict, type `git status`
- -> all `unmerged paths` can be considered a conflict
- there are multiple types of possible conflicts; to find out, which type of
 conflict you have now, carefully read the error message again that was thrown 
 right after you typed `git pull`
. If the error message says something like `CONFLICT (modify/delete)`:
* you need to decide whether to delete or to keep the files listet under 
 `untracked paths`
* if you want to keep them, type `git add [filelist]`
* if you want them to be deleted, type `git rm [filelist]`
* type `git status` to see, if you treated all conflicts
. If the error message says something like `CONFLICT (…)`
* __tbc__
- if there are any more files marked as `unstaged`, add them or check them out 
 accordingly
- as soon as `git status` doesn't show any more unstaged or unmerged files, you
 can finish that adventure by typing `git rebase --continue`
- if everything workes fine, the command line will say something like `…` which
 means that *you successfully solved your merge conflict!!!*


== Upload 
=== Checking the status of your local project copy
- open a terminal, `cd` to any project directory and then type `git status`
- -> many interesting status info of your project will be shown, such as the
 branch you're currently on, whether your local project contains the latest 
 changes uploaded to the project, and a list of files with changes that are not
 staged (which means waiting to be uploaded) yet

=== Uploading your changes or newly created documents
- open a terminal and type `git add [filelist]` and replace `[filelist]` by one
 or many paths to files you've changed or newly created and that you want to
 upload
*Tip*:: *Always* specify the files you want to stage, even if there are lots of
 them! `git status` will help you identify them. (Don't simply type `git add`
 without the filelist, because then all files that were changed or created are 
 being staged (including useless metadata files created by your IDE)!)
- -> these files are now staged, which means waiting to be uploaded
- if you think you've made enough changes to upload a new version of the project
 and staged all these changes, type `git commit`
- now a screen with a twinkling cursor and lots of text will appear
- type in a short message that describes the changes that you're about to upload
 (such as `Inserted "Hello World" button to user interface`)
- press *__Ctrl__*+*__X__* to finish message typing
- press *__Y__* to confirm this
- press *__Enter__* to confirm that you want to confirm
*Tip*:: For good *Git* style, please always write a useful commit message ;-)!
- -> now you've locally created a new project version, called __commit__
- before you finally upload that commit, type `git pull` (just in case some evil
 merge conflicts occur, this way you can solve them locally on your machine
 without the risk of messing up the online repository)
- now you can upload the commit by typing `git push`
- If everything worked fine (and your computer tells something like `writing 
 objects…`, *you've successfully uploaded your changes to the project!*
- If some conflicts occured while trying to download or upload, see the
 __Solving merge conflicts__ section


== Undoing changes
=== Switching to a recent commit while keeping commit history as is
- if you just want to see (read) a recent state of the project while keeping 
 all the commit history (including your latest commit) as it is, you first need
 to determine the id of the commit, that you want to skip back to
- open a terminal and `cd` to a project directory
- to show the latest commits including their commit messages and timestamps, 
 type `git log` (the command `git log` takes a million different options, if you 
 need more information about the commits or prefer a prettier printing style –
 see the `git log` documentation for details)
- the long string after the keyword `commit` is the commit-id (something like 
 `64ded9ab77364baf2ecae7872698c48196bd9ec2`)
- -> copy the commit-id you want to skip back to
- close the log by typing `q`
- type `git checkout [commit-id]`
- if you're done checking out that commit and want to go back to the most recent
 state, type `git checkout [branchname]` and replace `[branchname]` with the 
 name of the branch to whose head you want to return
*Note*:: This is a read-only action. All the changes you made until the latest
 commit will keep living. In the old commit you can play around as much as you 
 like (including copying stuff). All the changes you make in the intermediate 
 old state will be discarded by the ultimate checkout.

=== Undoing your latest commit completely
- if you want to undo a complete commit, that you just made on your own machine,
 open a terminal and `cd` to a project directory
- if you're currently not on the branch you made your latest commit to, type 
 `git checkout [branchname]` and replace `[branchname]` with the name of the 
 branch you want to switch to
- to create a new commit, that undoes the changes made by the latest commit, 
 type `git revert HEAD`
- if you had already uploaded the faulty commit, you can get the online
 repository clean simlpy by `git push`ing the new state as usual

=== Resetting a single file to a recent state
. If you want to reset a file to the state it had some commits before, you first
 need to determine the id of the commit, that brought the file to state that you
 want it to have now
* open a terminal and `cd` to a project directory
* to show the latest commits including their commit messages and timestamps, 
 type `git log` (the command `git log` takes a million different options, if you 
 need more information about the commits or prefer a prettier printing style –
 see the `git log` documentation for details)
* the long string after the keyword `commit` is the commit-id (something like 
 `64ded9ab77364baf2ecae7872698c48196bd9ec2`)
* -> copy the commit-id you want to reset your file to
* close the log by typing `q`
* to reset the file, type `git checkout [commit-id] [file]`
* -> the file is now being reset to that state and needs to be staged and 
 committed to add it to a new commit 
*Note*:: This means that the reset itself is an action that can be reverted, at
 least to any commit before the reset; uncommitted changes will yet be 
 unrecoverably lost.
. If you just want to discard the changes you made to a file since the last
 commit:
* open a terminal and `cd` to a project directory
* type `git checkout [file]`
*Note*:: All uncommitted changes will unrecoverably be lost.



== Project structure
=== Creating and switching branches
- open a terminal and `cd` to any project directory
- to show all available branches, type `git branch`
- to switch to another branch, type `git checkout [branchname]`
*Tip*:: Before you can switch to another branch, all changes you made to the
 current branch need to be staged (`git add [filelist]`).
- to create a new branch, type `git branch [branchname]`
*Tip*:: For good *Git* style, always work inside a branch other than the so 
 called __master__ branch. Only move your work to the __master__ branch, if they
 are proved to be correct and ment to remain in the project till the end of
 time!
 
== Helpful *Git* configuration
=== Username and password caching
- to tell *Git* to remember your login credentials for a certain time, open a 
 terminal and type `git config --global credential.helper cache`
- to change the caching time (15 minutes by default), type `git config 
 --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=[timeout]'` and replace [timeout]
 with the time you wish (in seconds)
